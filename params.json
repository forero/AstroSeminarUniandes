We will meet up in Room Ip-105 every Friday at 1PM. During the first 15 minutes we will discuss the latest on Nature/Science or any other interesting paper on the arXiv. In the next 40 minutes we will try to have 2 talks. One by somebody external to Uniandes and the second one by local students or faculty. The talks will be done on the blackboard, if you really need it you can use a couple of slides.\r\n\r\nAh! And this is Astro **Lunch**. Remember to bring your own lunch. We will try to have some pizza to share.\r\n\r\n##Programme (2013-I)\r\n\r\n### Week 1 (January 24)\r\n\r\n* **A Vast Thin Plane of Co-rotating Dwarf Galaxies Orbiting the Andromeda Galaxy** http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.0446\r\n* The rest of the seminar was spent explaining the mechanics for AstroLunch.\r\n\r\n### Week 2 (February 1st )\r\n\r\n* Paper **A black-hole mass measurement from molecular gas kinematics in NGC4526** http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7184\r\n* Frederic Courbin (EPFL, Switzerland). Expert on strong lensing. Some insights into his recent research\r\n* Jaime E. Forero-Romero. [Projects on theoretical galaxy formation](https://github.com/forero/AstroSeminarUniandes/blob/master/projects/ForeroRomero.txt).\r\n* Benjamin Oostra. [Project on solar rotation (using spectra)](https://github.com/forero/AstroSeminarUniandes/blob/master/projects/Oostra.txt).\r\n* Santiago Vargas. [Project on solar rotation (following sunspots)](https://github.com/forero/AstroSeminarUniandes/blob/master/projects/Vargas.txt).\r\n* Juan Camilo Buitrago. [Project on sunspot classification](https://github.com/forero/AstroSeminarUniandes/blob/master/projects/Buitrago.txt).\r\n\r\n### Week 3 (February 8)\r\n* Paper\r\n* Camilo Pabon\r\n* \r\n\r\n##Grading\r\n\r\nIf you are getting credits from this seminar, you have to be graded. We will grade attendance (20%), class participation -give at least one talk- (20%) and a project (30% first report + 30% final report). The project can be anything from studying an interesting paper to dealing with a research project that might end up being the subject for your undergrad thesis.\r\n\r\n##Contact\r\nJaime E. Forero-Romero (http://wwwprof.uniandes.edu.co/~je.forero/ email: je.forero) will lead the seminar during 2013-I. Contact him if you want to give a talk or know more about AstroLunch.\r\n"}
