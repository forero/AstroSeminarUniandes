We will meet up in Room Ip-105 every Friday at 1PM. During the first 15 minutes we will discuss the latest on Nature/Science or any other interesting paper on the arXiv. In the next 40 minutes we will try to have 2 talks. One by somebody external to Uniandes and the second one by local students or faculty. The talks will be done on the blackboard, if you really need it you can use a couple of slides.\r\n\r\nAh! And this is Astro **Lunch**. Remember to bring your lunch. We will have some pizza.\r\n\r\n###Programme\r\n1. Week 1 (January 24)\r\n[The paper] http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.0446\r\nThe rest of the talk was spent explaining how the seminar will work.\r\n\r\n2.

The project can be anything from studying an interesting paper to dealing with a research project that might end up being the theme for your undergrad thesis.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Program\r\n\r\n###Contact\r\nJaime E.
