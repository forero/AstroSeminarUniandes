{"name":"AstroLunch","tagline":"Summarizes the topics we have discussed in the Astronomy Seminar (AKA AstroLunch@Uniandes)","body":"## Welcome\r\nIn this webpage we will keep track of the topics discussed (or to be discussed) during AstroLunch @Uniandes. We will meet up in Room Ip-105 every Friday at 1PM. During the first 15 minutes we will discuss the latest in the journals (Nature or Science) or any other interesting paper on the arXiv. In the next 40 minutes we will try to have 2 talks. One by somebody external to Uniandes and the second one by local students or faculty. The talks will be done on the blackboard, if you really need it you can use a couple of slides.\r\n\r\nAh! And this is Astro **Lunch**. Remember to bring your own lunch. We will **try** to have some pizza to share.\r\n\r\n##Programme (2013-I)\r\n\r\n### Week 1 (January 24)\r\n\r\n* **A Vast Thin Plane of Co-rotating Dwarf Galaxies Orbiting the Andromeda Galaxy** http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.0446\r\n* The rest of the seminar was spent explaining the mechanics for AstroLunch.\r\n\r\n### Week 2 (February 1st )\r\n\r\n* Paper **A black-hole mass measurement from molecular gas kinematics in NGC4526** http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7184\r\n* Frederic Courbin (EPFL, Switzerland).

We will grade attendance (20%), class participation -give at least one talk- (20%) and a project (30% first report + 30% final report). The project can be anything from studying an interesting paper to dealing with a research project that might end up being the subject for your undergrad thesis.\r\n\r\n##Contact\r\nJaime E. Forero-Romero (http://wwwprof.uniandes.edu.co/~je.forero/ email: je.forero) will lead the seminar during 2013-I. Contact him if you want to give a talk or know more about AstroLunch.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
