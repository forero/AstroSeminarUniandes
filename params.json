During the first 15 minutes we will discuss the latest on Nature/Science or any other interesting paper on the arXiv. In the next 40 minutes we will try to have 2 talks. One by somebody external to Uniandes and the second one by local students or faculty. The talks will be done on the blackboard, if you really need it you can use a couple of slides.\r\n\r\nAh! And this is Astro **Lunch**. Remember to bring your lunch. We will have some pizza.\r\n\r\n###Rules\r\n\r\nIf you are getting credits from this seminar, you have to be graded. We will take attendance (20%), class participation -ask questions!- (30%) and a project (20% oral presentation + 30% written report). The project can be anything from studying an interesting paper to dealing with a research project that might end up being the theme for your undergrad thesis.\r\n\r\nJaime E. Forero-Romero (http://wwwprof.uniandes.edu.co/~je.forero/ email: je.forero) will lead the seminar during 2013-I.\r\n"}
