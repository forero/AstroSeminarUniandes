          <h3>Welcome</h3>

<p>n this webpage we will keep track of the topics discussed (or to be discussed) during AstroLunch @Uniandes. We will meet up in Room Ip-105 every Friday at 1PM. During the first 15 minutes we will discuss the latest on Nature/Science or any other interesting paper on the arXiv. In the next 40 minutes we will try to have 2 talks. One by somebody external to Uniandes and the second one by local students or faculty. The talks will be done on the blackboard, if you really need it you can use a couple of slides.</p>

<p>Ah! And this is Astro <strong>Lunch</strong>. Remember to bring your lunch. We will have some pizza.</p>
